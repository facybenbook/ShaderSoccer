# SHADER SOCCER

This is a simple game developed as a collaborative project in the http://www.reddit.com/r/hobbygamedev sub-reddit.  It was developed between November 2014 and March 2015 and is a web-based Unity game.

The game is similar to Pong but with some elements of foosball incorporated.  A few basic shaders can be applied to players on each team.

## Controls

Mouse clicks are used to navigate the GUI screens.  During main gameplay, WASD and the arrow keys move players on the left and right teams, respectively.
